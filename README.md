# **Ecommerce-Follow-Along**

This repository is for the mentor-led project where we are building an e-commerce application using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js). The project focuses on learning real-world development concepts and gaining hands-on experience in creating a full-stack application.

## **Milestone 1: Project Overview**

### **Project Description**
- The aim of this project is to develop a functional e-commerce application with features like user authentication, product management, and order handling.  
- The application will be built using the MERN stack, which enables full-stack development using JavaScript for both frontend and backend.  

### **What We Covered in the Session**
1. **Understanding the MERN Stack**  
   - **MERN** stands for **MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js**.  
   - It is a popular stack for creating full-stack applications because it uses JavaScript throughout the project.  

2. **REST API Basics**  
   - A REST API allows the frontend and backend to communicate using HTTP methods (like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).  
   - In this project, REST APIs will handle user authentication, product management, and order updates.  

3. **Database Schema Design**  
   - Schema design in **MongoDB** helps organize and structure the data for the application effectively.  

4. **Role of Authentication**  
   - Authentication ensures secure access by verifying users before allowing them to log in or make purchases.
